	<p>The HDF5 abstraction layer mostly follows the HDF5 naming convention of <code>H5Xfunction_name</code>, where
	<code>X</code> is usually a single letter identifying the section of the API that the function resides in. A
	<code>cbf_</code> prefix is used on all functions to avoid naming conflicts and make it clear that all these
	functions use the CBFlib error handling method whenever an error may occur.</p>
	<p>The main purpose of this API is to not to reimplement the HDF5 API, but to make common HDF5-related tasks
	easier when working with HDF5 files within CBFlib. The API therefore doesn't attempt to cover every possible use
	of HDF5, but to simplify common tasks. Use of the HDF5 API is not unexpected in library or user code, but
	functions in this section should be preferred in order to reduce development time and the amount of debugging
	required. A relatively comprehensive test program is provided, this should be used to verify that the functions in
	this section of the API are performing as expected and can be used as a source of example code.</p>
