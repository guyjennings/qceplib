# Create links needed by MinGW to various libraries that exist on
# the windows file system. The basic idea is that we link in the Windows
# installed versions of these libraries and make then look like 
# standard unix libraries for configure to pick up. An alternative would be
# to build the HDF etc. libraries from source under MinGW
#
# first create the /usr/local hierarchy 
#
for i in /usr/local /usr/local/include /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib \
         /usr/local/hdf4 /usr/local/hdf4/lib \
         /usr/local/hdf5 /usr/local/hdf5/lib ; do
    [ -d $i ] || mkdir $i
done
