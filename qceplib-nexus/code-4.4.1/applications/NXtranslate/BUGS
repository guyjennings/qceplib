This file contains a list of known bugs in NXtranslate or one of the
libraries it depends on. Being smart about how you write your
translation file will be able to avoid most of them.

OPENING A NEXUS FILE MULTIPLE TIMES - There is an inconsistent bug in
the NeXus API (napi) where the library will crash if a NeXus file is
opened for read, closed, then opened for reading again. I have been
unable to reproduce it in a sample code to submit to the NeXus
developers.

LINKING TO A ROOT GROUP - Creating a link to a group that exists at
the root level (e.g. a NXentry) will move the group, not create a
copy. If the link is at the same level, just inside the root, the
group will be renamed. If the link is somewhere else in hierarchy the
group will be moved to that point.

RETURNING AN EMPTY TREE - The retrievers are assumed that they add at
least one Node to the tree they are given for population. If they do
not the xml_parser will crash. The user cannot create this error, only
a programmer can. Instead of returning an empty tree the Retriever
should throw an exception (invalid_argument, runtime_error, or
exception) to notify xml_parser of the extraordinary call.
