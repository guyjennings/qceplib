Both dynamic library versions (e.g. napi_test-hdf4) and 
static library versions (e.g. napi_test-hdf4-static) of the test
programs are now build. 

Static Library Version
----------------------

The static version "napi_test-hdf4-static" is a real self contained
executable and you can run it either directly or in a debugger with simply

    gdb napi_test-hdf4-static

Dynamic Library Version
-----------------------

"napi_test-hdf4" is not a real executable, but a shell script that
invokes the real dynamic executable ".libs/napi_test-hdf4". Though
you can run ".libs/napi_test-hdf4" directly you should be aware that
it will then pick up whatever NeXus library is either currently in your 
LD_* environment variable paths or installed in a system shared library 
area (such as /usr/local/lib)

To test the NeXus shared library you have just built you must use 
the shell script "napi_test-hdf4" which will set
the correct environment before running ".libs/napi_test-hdf4"

If you wish to run the program in a debugger you must use

    libtool --mode=execute gdb napi_test-hdf4

To check what shared libraries the program will load run

    libtool --mode=execute ldd napi_test-hdf4
