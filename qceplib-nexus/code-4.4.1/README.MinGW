Install MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/ using the MINGW installer -
I used MinGW-5.0.2.exe and installed the "current" binaries. As you need
to install MSYS later on, DO NOT install MINGW make.

Now download the MSYS installer (I used MSYS-1.0.10.exe) and also the MSYS developer toolkit (msysDTK-1.0.1.exe in my case) from the MinGW downloads page and install. You also need to install mingw-utils (for the pexports command), which you download as a .tar.gz file and then unpack to your c:/MinGW directory

Start MSYS, unpack the nexus distribution and edit the file "make_mingw_links" in the top directory as instructed within it; then run it 

If you wish a Microsoft compatible import library (.LIB file that references a DLL) to also be built, you need to make sure the LIB command is available in your MinGW path. Type LIB at the MSYS prompt now to check if this is so.

Edit applications/NXtranslate/text_xml/Makefile.am and 
applications/NXtranslate/Makefile.am and in both replace
`xml2-config --cflags`  with  -I/usr/local/include in  AM_CPPFLAGS

Now just type

  ./configure
  make
  make check
  make install

To build the JAVA interface with gcj you need to pass the JAVA home
directory to configure. If your gcj command is  /mingw/bin/gcj  then use

  ./configure --with-java-home=/mingw

If you get a compile error about redeclaration of ssize_t when including the HDF5 header, you need to edit /usr/local/hdf5/include/H5pubconf.h and change the definition of H5_SIZEOF_SSIZE_T to e.g.

#define H5_SIZEOF_SSIZE_T  4 /* for 32 bit machines */


After building and installing you should get

${prefix}/lib/libNeXus.a       : static library
${prefix}/lib/libNeXus.dll.a   : import library for libNeXus-0.dll
${prefix}/bin/libNeXus-0.dll   : NeXus shared library
${prefix}/bin/libNeXus-0.dll.lib : MS compatible import library for libNeXus-0.dll (only built if you have ther LIB command in your path)


Enjoy!



Use libtool 1.5 but note it has problems as MinGW does not ship the unix "file" command so you get "file magic" errors

to remedy, install  scripts/file.MinGW   as /usr/local/bin/file and chmod +x it

also rename libmxml.a as libmxml.dll.a
