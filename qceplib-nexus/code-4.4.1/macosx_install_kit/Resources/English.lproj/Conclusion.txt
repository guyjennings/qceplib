A note on pre-10.5 Macintosh

You may need to add /Library/Python/2.5/site-packages to your python path.
If you are using the python.org distribution of python-2.5 this is already 
done for you.  Otherwise, add the following file to your site-packages
directory:

--Library_Python.pth--
/Library/Python/2.5/site-packages
