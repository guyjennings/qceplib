	JNEXUS

        The NeXus API for Java (JAPI) is implemented by a class NexusFile
        which calls the C-language NeXus-API through the Java Native
   	Methods Interface (JNI). For more documentation see the API
        documentation in the directory apidoc and the class TestJapi.java
        in directory test which not only serves as a test driver for
     	the JAPI but also as a code example for the usage of the NexusFile
        methods. 


        ACKNOWLEGDEMENT

	This library uses a lot of code taken from the Java HDF Interface
        libraries provided by the NCSA-HDF team. Essentially all the number
	conversion code is taken from there. Also, the JHI served as a
        valuable source for inspiration during the devlopment of this 
	library. Please see the file COPYING.NCSA for more details. See
	JHI version from which the code was extracted was JHI-2.5 as 
	downloaded in October 2000. 


	USAGE
	
	As the JAPI uses native methods your Java runtime needs to locate the
   	shared library implementing the NAPI. Otherwise you will get an
        Unsatisfied Link Error. There are three possibilities how the Java 
        runtime can locate the shared library:
	- You or your system administrator puts the shared library into the
          systems default location for shared libraries. On Windows
          platforms this is any directory on the PATH, on a Unix system it
          is usually something like /usr/shlib. 
	- You put it wherever you want on your unix system and set the 
          environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to that directory.
	  More info on this in the manpages of your systems loader.
	- You explicitly tell the Java Runtime where the shared library is
	  through the -Dorg.nexusformat.JNEXUSLIB=full-path-to-library
	  option.  

        Furthermore you need to include the jnexus.jar file in your Java
        classpath both for compiling and running Java programs using the 
        JAPI.
 
        As an example, see the runtestxx scripts supplied in the test
        directory for running the test driver.
