Installation Instructions
=========================

Unix (including Mac OS X) source distribution
---------------------------------------------

If you have downloaded a source distribution (e.g. nexus-4.3.0.tar.gz) then you will already have a file called "configure" and the basic sequence to follow is:

    ./configure  # use    sh ./configure    if this does not work
    make
    make check
    make install

this may not, however, build all the nexus utilities and binding you require, and may also locate the wrong HDF libraries and final installation directory. Thus you will probably need to pass some options to "configure" to control this.

General information about "configure" is located in the file called INSTALL

To see a list of possible options type

    ./configure --help

HDF libraries used by nexus are available via your system software package manager or can be downloaded from http://www.hdfgroup.org/

A typical run of configure might be:

    ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/nexus --with-hdf5=/usr/local/hdf5

Unix (including Mac OS X) svn checkout
--------------------------------------

As the "configure" file mentioned is a generated file, it is not included in the version control checkout. To create it run:

   sh autogen.sh

and then follow the same procedure as above. You may also want to look at the README.developers file
