   This directory contains the files for the SWIG interface to the 
   NeXus-API. SWIG (http://www.swig.org) is a tool which takes as 
   input a description of a C language interface and creates the wrapper
   code for the inclusion of the C code into various scripting languages.

   For more information and for procedures how to compile and link the
   generated scripting language extension please consult the SWIG manual
   and the example files delivered with the SWIG package.

   Available files:
   - nxinter.i The SWIG interface description
   - nxinterhelper.c, nxinterhelper.h helper functions for the interface
   - nxdataset.h, nxdataset.c  dataset functions
   - nxdataset.i Interface for the dataset functions.
   - nxinter.tex  brief documentation.
   - Makefile Makefile for generating Tcl and mzscheme wrappers.
   - various test files.
