CHANGES
======================================================================
v0.2.5 - May 7, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Fixed bug in converting void* to concrete types. Also
  added support for NX_INT8 and NX_UINT8.

v0.2.4 - April 15, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Added ability to write an NXdata to file as long as
  the rank of the data is one or two.

v0.2.3 - March 17, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Implemented a separate recursion level for building
  and purging tree. Now relative and absolute paths act the same way.

  P.F.Peterson - Added ability to anchor at the end of a path.

v0.2.2 - February 17, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Fixed infinite loop bug when path was specified as "*".

  P.F.Peterson - Made recursion option invisible.

  P.F.Peterson - Fixed bug where code entered an infinite loop when
  parameters that required values were not given values.

v0.2.1 - February 13, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Made "*" fully functional in absolute paths.

  P.F.Peterson - Added "*" to list of characters with special meaning
  in the path. Works completely with relative paths, but only at
  begining or end of absolute paths.

  P.F.Peterson - Added verbose flag which prints message if nothing
  found in file.

  P.F.Peterson - If only one file is detected do not print filename on
  output.

  P.F.Peterson - Changed style of command line argument with flags to
  allow space between flag and value.

v0.2.0 - February 03, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Added hooks to allow for changing format of how tree
  and data is printed. Exposed those to the command line.

  P.F.Peterson - Major rewrite to have -p be both relative and
  absolute path, also allowing to specify name, type, or any (with
  '.').

  P.F.Peterson - Put default values for command line options in
  'nxdir.h'.

v0.1.0 - January 15, 2004

  P.F.Peterson - Promoted attributes to the level of fields (less
  special code).

  P.F.Peterson - Fixed bug in tree purging code.

  P.F.Peterson - Added code to allow for arbitraray attribute
  retrieving.

  P.F.Peterson - Improved performence of converting data to string by
  one order of magnitude. Also added hooks in main.cpp for timing
  tests.

  P.F.Peterson - Added a recurse option (needs to be smarter), long
  option (how much of arrays to print), and rudimentary ability to
  print 2D arrays.

  P.Kienzle - Fixed string_util.cpp by adding a couple of "using
  lines".

  P.F.Peterson - Added README, LICENSE, CHANGES, and TODO

v0.0.1 - January 6, 2004
