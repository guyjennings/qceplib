NeXus example programs and files
--------------------------------

napi_test.c uses the name of the executable file
it is compiled into to determine what type of file to create
i.e. HDF5 if it is called napi_test-hdf5  etc.

You can build these examples using the  nxbuild  script
that is installed into /usr/local/bin e.g.

    nxbuild -o napi_test-hdf5 napi_test.c
